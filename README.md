# IDS-706-Proj2

The repository contains the files utilized for Mini-Project 2 which includes:
1. Makefile
2. Requirements.txt
3. Python Files
4. Github Actions
5. CSV file for data analysis

## Purpose of the Project: 
The aim of the project is to utilize the skeleton repository created in the earlier project to help with analyzing datasets using statistics and libraries like Pandas. I used the 'forbes_2022_billionaires.csv' to analyze the average 'FinalWorth' of billionaires in various countries. Bar Chart was used from the Plotly library to visualize the output from this analysis.

## Code Description: 
stats_descriptive.py - A python file that uses 3 functions to calculate mean, median, mode and standard deviation
test_stats.py - A python file that reads the forbes_2022_billionaires.csv file and tests the four functions in stats_descriptive.py.  
visualization.py - This contains the code to analyze and visualize the output. 

The output of the visualization is :
